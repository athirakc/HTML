    <h1>TOURISM</h1>
    <p>Tourism is the movement of people to places for the purpose of visiting attractions, sightseeing, and recreation. It is a major industry in the world, generating trillions of dollars in revenue and supporting millions of jobs.<br>
        Tourism can be divided into two main types: domestic and international. Domestic tourism refers to travel within a country, while international tourism refers to travel between countries.<br>
        There are many reasons why people choose to travel. Some people travel to learn about different cultures and traditions, while others travel to relax and escape from the stresses of everyday life. Still others travel to experience new activities and attractions.
