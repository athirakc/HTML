    ABOUT US

          CONCORD Arts and Science college is part of an ambitious project of Kannur International Educational Trust (KIET), a congregation of educational experts, industrialists and NRIs. 
          The Trust intends to develop an integrated campus-Concord Educity at Muttanur with a Public school, and a Business School as well.
          CONCORD believes that in the changing scenario a higher education institution should always think beyond the present and prepare the students for their future professional careers. 
          A responsible institution of higher learning should impart academic knowledge and provide impetus for intellectual, creative, cultural and socio-political growth and development of 
          the students. Aligned to this philosophy, CONCORD encourages the students to go beyond the confines of academic disciplines to explore their talents and interests in new vistas through
          their various cultural, extra curricular and co curricular activities.The goal of the college is to nurture students so as to develop a holistic personality with special emphasis on 
          character, culture and moral and ethical values.
          CONCORD college offers international standards of education at affordable rates. The fees structure and the curriculum have been designed to match the abilities and capacities of the 
          students and parents of this location.
