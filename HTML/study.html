    <h4>My Qualification</h4>
    <P>My journey as a student has always been focused on the path to college and success. Before I even set foot in kindergarten my mother, a college dropout, always told me that “honor roll wasn't an option” and that I would be attending college in the future and achieving a degree.</P>
