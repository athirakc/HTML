   <h1>Life</h1><hr>
   <p>Life is full of both joys and disasters. <br>
      The ups and downs of life are what they're called. <br>
      Without them, life is just a never-ending war that can be won at any time. <br>
      To overcome one's    grief, it is necessary to find happiness in one's life. </p>
